\usage{
writemath(formula_, output = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula_}{The \strong{formula_} parameter allows a user to specify a model formula, such as \code{CPI~ER+PPI+asym(ER)+deterministic(covid)+trend}, to define the relationships in the analysis. Alternatively, if a user provide a kardl output object, the function will automatically extract all necessary variables and parameters from this object, simplifying the setup process. This flexibility enables users to define the model structure either through a formula or directly from an existing analysis object.}

\item{output}{The output parameter specifies the path and file name for saving output equations.
\itemize{
 \item \strong{MS Word Output}: If output is set with a \strong{.docx} extension, the equations will be saved as a \strong{Word} document.
 \item \strong{LaTeX Output}: If specified with a \strong{.tex} extension, the equations will be saved as a \strong{LaTeX} file.
 \item \strong{Markdown Output}: If specified with a \strong{.rm} extension, the equations will be saved as a \strong{Markdown} file.
 \item \strong{PDF Output}: If specified with a \strong{.pdf} extension, the equations will be saved as a \strong{PDF} file.
 \item \strong{Display on terminal}
 \itemize{
     \item \strong{1}: Using \strong{1} as the output displays \strong{LaTeX} formatted equations on the screen without saving to a file.
     \item \strong{2}: Setting output to \strong{2} displays equations in \strong{Markdown} on terminal.
     \item \strong{3}: Setting output to \strong{3} displays the equations as \strong{OpenOffice}-compatible math formulas on terminal.
         }
}

If \emph{output} is specified without directory paths (i.e., without / for Linux or \\\\ for Windows), the file will be saved in the current working directory, which can be identified by calling the \code{getwd()} function. This feature ensures that, in the absence of a specified path, files are saved to a known default location.

\description{
The \strong{writemath} function generates all necessary equations for analysis, including those for ARDL, NARDL, short-run and long-run nonlinearities, and dynamic multipliers. It produces these equations in multiple formats: as text and as files compatible with MS Word, Markdown, LaTeX, and LibreOffice. This function provides a comprehensive set of formulas essential for econometric analysis, facilitating easy access to equations across various document formats for efficient reporting and presentation.
